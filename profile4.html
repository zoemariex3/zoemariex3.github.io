                <h3>Bio:</h3>
                <P>Grace Hopper [1906-1992] was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.  She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer and was a pioneer of computer programming.  She invented one of the first linkers; she developed a compiler that was a precursor to the widely used COBOL [Common Business Oriented Language], which is used for writing application programs in defense, banking and insurance domains.  Today, any large data processing makes extensive use of COBOL.</P>

            <h3>Main Achievements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Joined U.S. Navy during World War 2 and was assigned to program the Mark 1 computer</li>
                    <li>Received masters degree in mathematics in 1930</li>
                    <li>Earned a ph.D in mathematics in 1934</li>
                    <li>Became Rear Admiral at 60 years old</li>
                    <li>In 1991 she was awarded the National Medal of Technology - the first female to receive this honor</li>
                    <li>She was able to get government agencies and industry to agree on using the common business programming language [COBOL]</li>
                    <li>Awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.</li>
                    <li>Hopper is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches.
                        <br>While she was working on a computer in 1947, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were "debugging" the system.
                    The <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334663">remains of the moth</a> can be found in the Smithsonian Museum, in Washington DC.</li>

                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grace Hopper was a pioneer in computer languages at a time when this was a more male-orientated field</li>
                        <li>Grace's legacy continues by encouraging young people to learn how to program through 'The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference</li>
                        <li>The Grace Murray Hopper award is given to an outstanding young computer professional of the year, selected on the basis of a single recent major technical or service contribution.  </li>
                        <li>She became the director of programming languages in the Navy's Office of Information Systems between 1967 and 1977 and was promoted to captain in 1973. </li>
                        <li>Google celebrated her achievements in a <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/grace-hoppers-107th-birthday">Google Doodle</a> on what would have been her 107th birthday  </li>
                        <li>One of Hopper's most famous quotes is: "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."</li>

            <p>Grace Hopper is an inspiration and her work remains part of everyday life - when you withdraw money from a cash machine, a COBOL program is used and many financial and banking systems still rely on the COBOL program. She was passionate about her work and continued to work into her 80s despite having retired.  In her career, she amassed many awards for her services to the American Navy and for her contirubution to computer science.
